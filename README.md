Example: Use title case for "System Requirements" and sentence case for "Hardware requirements."
5. Make Headings Descriptive
Tip: Ensure headings clearly reflect the content of the section.
Why: Descriptive headings help readers know what to expect, enhancing document navigation.
Example: "Database Design" is more specific than just "Design."
6. Use Parallel Structure
Tip: Maintain parallelism in a series of headings (e.g., each heading starts with the same part of speech).
Why: Parallel structure ensures consistency and improves readability.
Example:
"Setting Up the Development Environment"
"Configuring the Database"
"Deploying the Application"
7. Incorporate Keywords
Tip: Include relevant keywords to improve clarity and SEO (if applicable).
Why: Helps readers quickly find key information and increases searchability.
Example: "User Authentication Process" is more specific than just "Authentication."
8. Avoid Overuse of Technical Jargon
Tip: Use simple, clear language for headings, especially in user-facing documentation.
Why: Plain language ensures your document is accessible to a wider audience.
Example: Instead of "Optimizing Database Queries," use "Improving Database Performance."
9. Use Actionable Language
Tip: Frame headings in a way that suggests an action or outcome, particularly in guides and tutorials.
Why: Actionable headings can engage readers and encourage them to take action.
Example: "Learn How to Configure Security Settings" instead of just "Configuring Security Settings."
10. Avoid Overcrowding Headings
Tip: Don't overload headings with too much detail. Break complex topics into smaller sections.
Why: Short and focused headings make content easier to navigate and prevent overwhelming readers.
Example: Break "Troubleshooting Common Installation, Setup, and Configuration Issues" into:
"Troubleshooting Installation Issues"
"Setup Issues"
"Configuration Problems"
11. Use Numbering for Long Documents
Tip: For lengthy documents, use numbered headings to maintain order.
Why: Numbered headings make complex documents more organized and help readers find specific sections.
Example:
1.0 Introduction
2.0 System Setup
2.1 Installation Guide
12. Make Headings Relevant to Content
Tip: Ensure each heading directly reflects the content of the section.
Why: Irrelevant headings confuse readers and hinder document navigation.
Example: If the section discusses testing, don't use "Software Overview." Instead, use "Software Testing" or "Test Cases."
